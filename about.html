            <h1>About me</h1>
            <div class="intro-text">
                <p>I’m a Master’s student in Human Centered Design & Engineering at the University of Washington, specializing in <span class="highlight">User Experience Research and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)</span>. My passion is to bridge <span class="highlight">research, design, and engineering</span> to create data-informed, user-centered solutions that enhance usability, trust, and engagement.</p> 
                
                <p>I focus on how <span class="highlight">design decisions and ethical frameworks</span> shape human interaction with intelligent systems, and how <span class="highlight">insight-driven research</span> can guide scalable, responsible innovation in AI and robotics. My goal is to build products and experiences that are not only efficient—but also emotionally meaningful and socially responsible.</p>
